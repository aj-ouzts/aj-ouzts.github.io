A lot of people refer to me as a good listener and it has a lot to do with my personality. I’m a firm believer that you can learn from anyone be it children, the elderly, and all those in between. I believe in becoming a good problem solver you have to be able to observe a situation with being able to find the needs and the root cause of what the problem may be. Also, I find it a sign of respect to actively listen to people, because you learn that sometimes what’s not said is a key to solution. 

The observant aspect gives me room to adapt to whats needed in order to get things done. I’ve realized through life in general that the majority of the plans that are made never go the way its expected, and I have to respond and readjust. In order for me to effectively adapt I have to know my strengths and weaknesses and the strengths and weaknesses of those around me to solve an issue.

I find it with being an observant listener, when I do speak people will listen, mainly because they may be surprised, but also because I’ve taken the time to understand them fully on the matter and respect is reciprocated. For a person who’s been misunderstood quite a bit, I seek to understand others by observantly listening.
