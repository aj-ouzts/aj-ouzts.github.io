This may seem like a paradox to have for a strength, but bare with me. What has made me successful in most of the endeavors in my life has been that I’m not afraid to fail. I've failed classes, made mistakes at work, have had numerous errors in sports, burned food, intentionally and unintentionally hurt others, the list can go on. I’ve learned so much from the failures and mistakes,where I own them, learn from them, but they don't define me and I'll grow from them. One thing I like about playing baseball, is you get very acquainted with failure. To be considered a great hitter you fail 7 out of 10 times, so you adjust, move on, and continue to get better. It’s a great principal to learn and puts me in a place where I can have continued growth.  

When I’ve read up on other successful people you see that they’ve failed numerous times, but they just didn’t give up on themselves.  Something that bothers me sometimes with some people’s perspective, is they assume one gets to where they are through just talent and luck. I view that as being disrespectful to one’s hard work that went into getting better.
