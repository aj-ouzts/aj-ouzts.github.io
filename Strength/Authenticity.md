The foundation for myself being authentic has everything to do with having an identity reflected in my Personal Mission Statement. It gives me reason to be unapologetic about the core of who I am. I have confidence where I can appreciate the success of others, even those in my field, because I know me. Playing sports competitively, there’s naturally a tendency to compare myself with others. Still, I’ve learned to compete with myself instead and figure out different ways to grow in the confines of competition. 

It gives me the ability to respectfully disagree with people, even if I’m the only one standing on a certain point. It lets me separate ideas from people, understanding that everyone’s entitled to their opinion on situations and doesn’t take anything away from me to listen to understand, even if I disagree with them.
