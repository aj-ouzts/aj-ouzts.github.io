## Core Values

Core values are essential, in my opinion, for continued growth in making conscience and decisive decision. Since they are fundamentally principle based, they permeate in all facets of life. For me core values give me the ability to say yes and no to opportunities and situations, depending if they line up with who I'm trying to become. 

For each of my values they contain these elements:
- A verse from the Bible
- Quotes from influential people on the value.
- Reflections from me in how I relate with them.

I make it a habit to read them regularly along with my mission statements, in order to keep myself on track and grounded.
