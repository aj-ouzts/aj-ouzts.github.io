> At my essence, at my core, at my being, I am a storyteller. My life is the expression of my story. All of the events of my life are scenes, acts, moments, and instances that make up that story. Because I’m a storyteller I look for stories in all things. *I believe history itself is a story of the sovereignty of the triune God.* I believe being crafted in his own image we all have the yearning to tell stories and to experience stories.

I typically call my Passion Statement my essence. My essence is the portrayal of an intrinsic quality of myself, which is being a storyteller. I really love telling stories, talking about stories and observing stories in all types of fashions. I see the notion of a person’s reputation as the summary or the blurb of their story expressed by others.

This statement has given me a peace ever since I wrote it in 2018, because it helped me focus my aspirations. I’m naturally curious about a lot of things in life, which resulted in being proficient and liking a lot of different disciplines. That may seem like it’s such a great gift, and it is, but for me it was quite overwhelming, especially when deciding on a career path. It’s definitely a problem when your view on some of your gifts becomes warped and you view them as a curse, because they bring you unwanted anxieties and complexities. 

However, being able to reflect on who I am, first in my relationship with God and Christ, as well as in who I want to become, I came to solution to simplify my passions to something that permeates all aspects of my curiosities. That being a storyteller. I’m in the midst of living my own unique story, but it’s also cool to be a supporting character or to make a cameo in other people’s unique stories as well.
