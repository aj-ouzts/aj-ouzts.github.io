<h2 id="content">Why a Personal Mission Statement?</h2>
<p>There are times where I get frustrated with me in the summer of 2018 because of this statement. It’s a beautiful ideal to model my life under, but there hasn’t been a day since I’ve written it where I haven’t felt like I’ve embodied this statement’s totality. However, I believe that’s the point of the statement. It gives me an outlook of continued growth through knowing my purpose no matter what I’m called to do and become in life, be it big or small. </p>

		<h3>Definition</h3>
		<p>I personally define a personal mission statement to be:</p>
		<blockquote>A <b>Personal Mission Statement</b> reflects one’s ideal mindset based on what they believe on truth for themselves projected from their heart and mind.</blockquote>
	</div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Purpose Driven Ambition</h3>
		<p>It’s the basis of my why in life, and it gives me my definition for success. A phrase I coined for myself is to be: <b><i>Purpose Driven Ambition: Striving with a conscience</i></b>. That’s why my original five core values are in the statement <i>(Diligence, Excellence, Gratitude, Humility, Integrity)</i> to help ground my ambition into lasting principles. </p>

<h3 id="content">Platform for Growth</h3>
<p>It also allows me to pursue being around others who value to grow with these same qualities, no matter their walk of life. I understand that not everyone believes in my worldview on life, and that’s their prerogative, but that does not mean I haven’t been inspired and learned from their growth and ideas. On the other hand, I believe anyone who gets to know me will also benefit from the core of who I am, which resonates with my Personal Mission Statement above.</p>
