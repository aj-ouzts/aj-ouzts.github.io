This is an interesting weakness of mine. It runs with my strength of being an observant listener. I’ve never been shy, but I have one of many sayings that I live by which is “no one cares how much you know, until they know how much you care”. Listening is one of the major ways I show how much I care and I’ll be rather vague in an answer, but because of that sometimes people get the totality what i think on a subject. I don’t really volunteer all of the information on a subject, though I don’t mind sharing if asked to go in-depth. I know my mom still gets irritated with my sometimes with this aspect of me, but it’s something I’m aware of and I’m working to get better at. 

I have this weird personality contradiction, where I’m very confident in my abilities and what I’m able to do, however I really don’t find myself that interesting at all. I find people much more interesting than me, which is why I like listening to other people as well. Best way to get information out of me is to ask direct questions. I actually respond really well with Q&A especially with why and how type questions because they call for an in-depth response or have follow-up questions.
