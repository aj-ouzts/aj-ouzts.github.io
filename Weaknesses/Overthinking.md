This is probably the bane of my existence. If I were to express the thoughts that run in my head on a daily basis they would overwhelm people, because they typically overwhelm me. This weakness messes with my sleep pattern from time to time, because the thoughts are always running. One way I mitigate this weakness is by writing which helps tremendously with getting all my thoughts done. Also, I make it a point to read fiction which also helps with the calming of my thoughts. 

Overthinking in how I relate to others has much to do with making a point as concise as possible instead of giving a dissertation on everything that it entails.
