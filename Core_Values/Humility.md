    <h3> 1 Peter 5:5-7 </h3>
        <b>
            <b><i>5</i></b> In the same way, you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you, dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” <b><i>6</i></b> So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor. <b><i>7</i></b> Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.

### Reflection

Humility is a unique core value, because of my background in athletics and accumulating knowledge on different subjects. I’ve never felt and I still don’t feel inferior to anyone no matter the status of the individual, because at the end of the day they’re human just like me. I welcome and expect other’s to have the same thoughts of me. Their position, authority, or accomplishments are definitely to be honored and they’ll get the full respect of what’s due in context of the situation, and I can appreciate that people do certain things better than me and vice versa. I believe, being humble does not mean you lack confidence, on the contrary I don’t think you can completely embody being humble without having confidence.

Truly confident people, from what I’ve observed, have no problem with letting others be all who they are even getting attention. I believe being humble is just doing and thinking of ways to make the lives of those around me better. The theme verse incapsulates Who my confident submission should be in.
