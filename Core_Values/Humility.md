    <h3> 1 Peter 5:5-7 </h3>
        <b>
            <b><i>5</i></b> In the same way, you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you, dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” <b><i>6</i></b> So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor. <b><i>7</i></b> Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.

### Reflection

Humility is a unique core value because of my background in athletics and accumulating knowledge on subjects; It’s a value I have to be aware of because it feeds into one of my major weaknesses of being a lone wolf. Being a lone wolf is how pride tends to manifest itself in my life. Some may not see it as a pride issue, but for me, it is.

I’ve never felt, and I still don’t feel inferior to anyone, no matter the individual’s status, because at the end of the day, we’re all human. A person’s position, authority, or accomplishments are definitely honored, and they’ll get the full respect for what’s due in the context of the situation. I can appreciate that people do certain things better than me and vice versa. 

I believe being humble does not mean you lack confidence; on the contrary, I don’t think you can completely embody being humble without having a confident hope. From what I’ve observed, genuine, confident people have no problem with letting others be all who they are, even getting attention. I believe being humble is just doing and thinking of ways to make the lives of those around me better. The theme verse encapsulates; Who my confident submission should be in ultimately.
