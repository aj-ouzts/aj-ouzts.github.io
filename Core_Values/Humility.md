    <h3> 1 Peter 5:5-7 </h3>
        <b>
            <b><i>5</i></b> In the same way, you who are younger must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you, dress yourselves in humility as you relate to one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” <b><i>6</i></b> So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor. <b><i>7</i></b> Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.
