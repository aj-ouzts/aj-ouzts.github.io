#### Reflection

I’ve been having a unique view on **courage** as I’ve learned to unpack this value and apply it consistently into my life. One way that has manifested itself is in en**couraging** other people. To en**courage** some means to give **courage** and confidence to someone. It sounds counterintuitive, but I gain more **courage** in my day to day when en**courage** other people, than when I try to . It becomes fun and infectious and it creates a cool culture. It takes nothing away from me as a person to en**courage** other people.
