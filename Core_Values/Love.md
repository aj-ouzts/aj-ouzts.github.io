    <h3> 1 John 3:18-20 </h3>
        <b>
            <b><i>18</i></b> Dear children, let’s not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions. <b><i>19</i></b> Our actions will show that we belong to the truth, so we will be confident when we stand before God. <b><i>20</i></b> Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything.

### Reflection

As a core value love is most important, though it wasn’t apart of my original core values. I really don’t like words that aren’t backed up by action, and like anyone I’ve been guilty of saying something or promising something and not following through. That’s why I like the theme verse because it challenges me to get better.

I’ve always had a problem with how love is portrayed especially within the English language, just because there’s multiple layers to it. I’m with the Greeks for having multiple words for love. At it’s core, I believe love is a choice not a feeling or an emotion and it’s expressed both by actions and words. Don’t get me wrong, feelings and emotions are what makes us human and they are present in the different types of love, but fundamentally love is a choice. 

I’m weird when it comes to the separation of love and like. As a Christian, I’m commanded to love everyone, which is interesting in itself, but I don’t like everyone, particularly depending on how they deal with people. I’m pretty sure most people have people in their life who they truly love, but don’t particularly like because of how they do things. Personally, I see like as the intimacy of love. This principle, I believe is expressed in the example of spending time with true friends. True friends, you dearly love even if it’s not expressed in those words, and you like being around them.
