    <h3> 1 John 3:18-20 </h3>
        <b>
            <b><i>18</i></b> Dear children, let’s not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions. <b><i>19</i></b> Our actions will show that we belong to the truth, so we will be confident when we stand before God. <b><i>20</i></b> Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything.

### Reflection

As a core value, love is most important, though it wasn’t apart of my original core values. I’m not too fond of words that aren’t backed up by action, and like anyone, I’ve been guilty of saying something or promising something and not following through. That’s why I like the theme verse because it challenges me to get better.

I’ve always had a problem with how love is portrayed, especially within the English language, because there are multiple layers. I’m with the Greeks for having different words for love. At its core, I believe love is a choice, not a feeling or an emotion, and it’s expressed both by actions and words. Don’t get me wrong; feelings and emotions make us human, and they are present in the different types of love, but fundamentally love is a choice. 

I’m weird when it comes to the separation of love and like. As a Christian, I’m commanded to love everyone, which is interesting in itself, but I don’t like everyone, mainly depending on how they deal with and treat people. I’m sure most people have people who they truly love but don’t particularly like because of how they do things. I see like as the intimacy of love. This principle, I believe, is expressed in the example of spending time with real friends. True friends, you dearly love even if it’s not shown in those words, and you like being around them.
