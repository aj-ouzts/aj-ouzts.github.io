### Reflection
Self-Control is the one core value I’m probably the most natural at displaying in my life. Most of this has to due with my natural temperament, as well as continually growing in this principle through trials and challenges. Self-Control gives me the ability to be flexible in a lot of situations, be it if I’m in isolation or within a group. This value has been cultivated primarily in the sports arena, especially baseball, because it’s one of the sports you have to wait your turn to contribute and can’t just dominate.

I’ve had some unique consequences with practicing self-control, where on one end, if things are going well in a situation and people are excited, I’ll typically be even-tempered. People will say, “Why are you so serious?”. On the other end, if all hell is breaking loose, I’ll typically be even-tempered, and people will say, “How can you be so casual(cavalier)?”. One of my primary goals is to bring peace and consistency to any situation, coupled with being dependable.

Like anyone, I get nervous, fearful, scared, frustrated, angry, and a whole gambit of other emotions, but if they can’t help the situation at hand, I tend to quiet the noise so that the situation can be handled with as little drama as possible.
