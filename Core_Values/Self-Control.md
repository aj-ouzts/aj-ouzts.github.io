### Reflection
Self-Control is the one core value I’m probably the most natural at displaying in my life. Most of this has to due with my natural temperament, as well as constantly growing in the principle through trials and challenges. Self-Control gives me an ability to be flexible in a lot situations, be it if I’m in isolation or if I’m within a group. This value has been cultivated primarily in the sports arena, especially baseball, because it’s one of the sports you have to wait your turn, in order to contribute and you can’t just dominate.

I’ve had some unique consequences with practicing self-control, where on one end, if things are going really well in a situation and people are excited, I’ll typically be even-tempered and people will say “Why are you so serious?”. On the other end, if all hell is breaking loose, I’ll typically be even-tempered and people will say, “How can you be so casual(cavalier)?”. One of my major goals is to bring a sense of peace and consistency to any situation coupled with being dependable.

Like anyone I get nervous, fearful, scared, frustrated, angry, and a whole gambit of other emotions, but if they can’t help the situation at hand, I tend to look to quite the noise, so the situation can be handled with as little drama as possible.
