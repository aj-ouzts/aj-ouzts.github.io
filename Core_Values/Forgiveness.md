### Reflection

I believe forgiveness is consistently missing within our culture and our personal lives as well. I firmly believe there are consequences to all decisions, however I believe we are far to self-righteous to see that we’ve all made mistakes and are looking to hold people to standards we ourselves are not willing to keep and reflect in our lives.  I’m definitely guilty of portraying such things, so this is no indictment on anyone else, and that’s why I make it a point to practice forgiveness, even when I don’t feel like it.

They’re are two types of forgiveness that I believe most struggle, myself included, which are forgiving others and forgiving ourselves. One of the most freeing sayings I live by and learned at a rather young age was that *not everyone is going to like me.* Simple yet the statement gives me the freedom to forgive people who may think poorly of me be it valid or a trivial matter on why they don’t like me. Yet the hardest part of forgiving others in my estimation is when people we are close too, hurt us deeply, which then results into the harder level of: forgiving ourselves. 

Personally, I don’t struggle much with this side of forgiveness, because thankfully the people I've been very close too throughout my life, mainly my nuclear family, have continued to cultivate the environment of forgive each other and asking for forgiveness. I believe learning to forgive one’s self, helps with breaking the shame attached to the past, in order for the present to be pleasant, giving hope for the future. I also, believe that this core value is expressed fully in the life of Christ.
