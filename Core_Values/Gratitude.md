### Reflection
Gratitude is a core value that I’ve learned to appreciate more, and more as time has passed. I’m starting to find the little things in life to be more enjoyable, even in the minutia of life, or when problems come my way. Throughout my life, I’ve learned that complaining doesn’t move me forward to the goals that I want to accomplish, and practicing gratitude helps me appreciate life and keeps me in a place of joy and happiness, even when life sucks.

I’ve found out that with consistent practice of gratitude, I find unique opportunities to grow and learn, and some of the best experiences I’ve had have come from just practicing this one value.
